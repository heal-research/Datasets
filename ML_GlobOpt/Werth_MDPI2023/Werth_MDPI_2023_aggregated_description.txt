Directory contains images created during the run.

Directly storing the raw evaluations would run to 100s of GBs of compressed data for even small experiments.

The Training-directory contains images "Interval <interval length> speedup <actual/achieved speed up> algorithm <algorithm name>.pdf"
and contains scatter plots x = "Time" vs y = "Prediction vs Actual Duration" with data lines relating to individual machines (numeric ids).

The Gantt-Directory
contains files of the name 
"Interval <interval length> Speedup <actual Speed up> Algorithm <algorithm name> Troughput <achieved name>.pdf"

and contain two images: A Gantt chart of the simulated resulting solution
A scatter plot coparing wall-lock-time (x) to the makespan imagined by the Optimizer at that time
